#In this problem you'll be given a chance to practice writing some while loops.

#1. Convert the following into code that uses a while loop.

#print 2
#prints 4
#prints 6
#prints 8
#prints 10
#prints Goodbye!

x = 2
while x < 11:
  print(x)
  x += 2
print('Goodbye!')

#2. Convert the following into code that uses a while loop.

#prints Hello!
#prints 10
#prints 8
#prints 6
#prints 4
#prints 2

x = 10
print('Hello!')
while x > 1:
  print(x)
  x -= 2

#3. Write a while loop that sums the values 1 through end, inclusive. end is a variable that we define for you. 
#So, for example, if we define end to be 6, your code should print out the result:
#21

x = 0
y = 0
while y <= end:
  x += y
  y += 1
print(x)
