#Exercise 4
#5 points possible (graded)
#ESTIMATED TIME TO COMPLETE: 8 minutes

#Below are some short Python programs. For each program, answer the associated question.

#Try to answer the questions without running the code. Check your answers, then run the code for the ones you get wrong.

Question 1

num = 0
while num <= 5:
  print(num)
  num += 1
print("Outisde of loop")
print(num)
#0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, Outside of loop, 6

Question 2

numberOfLoops = 0
numberOfApples = 2
while numberOfLoops < 10:
    numberOfApples *= 2
    numberOfApples += numberOfLoops
    numberOfLoops -= 1
print("Number of apples: " + str(numberOfApples))
#infinite loop

Question 3

num = 10
while num > 3:
    num -= 1
    print(num) 
#9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4

Question 4

num = 10
while True:
    if num < 7:
        print('Breaking out of loop')
        break
    print(num)
    num -= 1
print('Outside of loop')
#10, 9, 8, 7, Breaking out of loop, Outside of loop

Question 5

num = 100
while not False:
    if num < 0:
        break
print('num is: ' + str(num))
#infinite loop
