#In this problem you'll be given a chance to practice writing some for loops.

#1. Convert the following code into code that uses a for loop.

#prints 2
#prints 4
#prints 6
#prints 8
#prints 10
#prints Goodbye!

for x in range(2,11,2):
  print(x)
print('Goodbye!')

#2. Convert the following code into code that uses a for loop.

#prints Hello!
#prints 10
#prints 8
#prints 6
#prints 4
#prints 2

print('Hello!')
for x in range(10,1,-2):
  print(x)

#3. Write a for loop that sums the values 1 through end, inclusive. end is a variable that we define for you. 
#So, for example, if we define end to be 6, your code should print out the result:
#21

x = 0
for y in range(end+1):
  x += y
print(x)
