#Exercise: guess my number
#0.0/10.0 points (graded)
#ESTIMATED TIME TO COMPLETE: 15 minutes

#In this problem, you'll create a program that guesses a secret number!

#The program works as follows: you (the user) thinks of an integer between 0 (inclusive) and 100 (not inclusive). 
#The computer makes guesses, and you give it input - is its guess too high or too low? 
#Using bisection search, the computer will guess the user's secret number!

high = 100
low = 1
print("Please think of a number between 0 and 100!")
while True:
  ans = int((high + low)/2)
  print("Is your secret number " + str(ans) + "?")
  response = input("Enter 'h' to indicate the guess is too high. Enter 'l' to indicate the guess is too low. Enter 'c' to indicate I guessed correctly. ")
  if response == 'h':
     high = ans
  elif response == 'l':
      low = ans
  elif response == 'c':
     print("Game over. Your secret number was: " + str(ans))
     break
  else:
    print("Sorry, I did not understand your input.")
